    Soilgrids provides for different properties at different levels of
    granularity. For example, for the -1-30cm, 3 measurements for sand are
    given, one for each of the -1-5cm, 5-15cm, and 15-30cm layers. On the
    other hand, for OCS, a single value is given for the whole -1-30cm.
    
    Before comparing sand (or clay, or silt) with OCS, it is thus necessary
    to aggregate them up to the same level of granularity.
    
    Aggregating means is done by weighting each value according to the 
    thickness of the layer it represents, before summing the weighted 
    values.
    
    Once this has been done, it is possible to compare sand, silt, and clay
    with OCS.

        `skipna` (`bool`): Whether to propagate missing values when
