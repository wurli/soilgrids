    """Read and perform basic analysis of Soilgrids data.
    
    Provides a convenient interface to the Soilgrids API, and some basic data
    wrangling and analysis methods.
    
    Attributes:
        `data` (`pandas.DataFrame`): The data returned by the last call to 
            `get_points()` or `get_points_sample()`. Note that this generates
            a `ValueError` if called before either of these methods.
        `get_points()` (method): Query Soilgrids for soil properties at 
            specified locations.
        `get_points_sample()` (method): Query Soilgrids for soil properties at
            randomly sampled locations.
        `main_properties()` (method): Determine the most prevalent property (out 
            of sand, silt, and clay) for each location.
        `ocs_correlation()` (method): Determine the correlation between sand, 
            silt, clay, and OCS (organic carbon stock).
        `aggregate_means()` (method): Aggregate the means of soil properties 
            across depths.
